/* ThreadDemo1b:
 * 
 * Just like ThreadDemo1a, but uses the "implements Runnable"
 * way of creating a thread instead of "extends Thread".
 * 
 * Shows 3 threads with their output interspersed like this:
 * 
 * 012102010210001122201201121022 |
 * 
 * Synchronizing the "run" method does not cause the output
 * to become like this:
 * 
 * 000000000011111111112222222222 |
 * 
 * because each thread is attempting to lock its own
 * separate instance of ThreadDemo1b, so there's no
 * competition for locks.									*/
