/* ThreadDemo3c:
 * 
 * Uses a synchronized block and a lock object.
 * 
 * Shows how to use wait() and notify() so that
 * the threads alternate in a "clockwork" manner.
 * 
 * Does "industrial strength" checking to make sure
 * that all sub-threads are waiting before starting
 * the "clockwork" by doing a notify.
 * 
 * Using private static inner classes shields things
 * like the public run method from outside users.		*/
