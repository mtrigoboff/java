/* ThreadDemo3b:
 * 
 * Uses a synchronized block and a lock object.
 * 
 * Shows how to use wait() and notify() so that
 * the threads alternate in a clockwork manner.
 * 
 * Doesn't require call to Thread.yield() because
 * "main" thread sets subordinate thread priorities
 * to be higher than its own.
 *
 * Not "industrial strength," can behave unpredictably.		*/
